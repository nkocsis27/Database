Schema and hastables attached. 

Upon running the program, the current data is loaded into the respective hashtable. There are five different hashtables for specific schema. 
Functions including insert, delete, and lookup will also run automatically, but can be altered in main (part 1) for different types. At the end of each
function, the whole hashtable will print to display the results. The user will then be prompt for input to investigate a specific query, 
typing quit to move onto next query. Once done, the program will automatically do the relational alegbra operations, which also can be altered
in the main (part 3).
